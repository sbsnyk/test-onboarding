## Case Studies ##
* [Snyk Customer Value Study](https://snyk.io/reports/customer-value-study-2022/)
* [Atlassian](https://snyk.io/case-studies/atlassian/): "We were using our previous tool as a stopgap for container scanning on our Trello product, but we needed a product that could scale. That meant we wanted a product where we didnâ€™t have to manage our own infrastructure and that offered developer-friendly data for easier vulnerability remediation." (Will Ratner, Senior Product Security Engineer)
* [Citrix](https://snyk.io/case-studies/citrix/): "Our developers use virtually every language except COBOL and we use both cloud services and on-prem systems. Snyk tested well in our diverse environment and ticked off more boxes than the other tools we were testing." (Rob Hather, Security Product Manager)
* [Reddit](https://snyk.io/case-studies/reddit/): "Snyk is very dev-centric and was also easy for us to scale out without being disruptive to developers." (Spencer Koch, Reddit Security)
